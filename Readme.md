This project explores retail business insights by integrating three real-world datasets: Superstore Sales, Customer Analytics, and Income & Demographics. Using R and Quarto, the project delivers a comprehensive analysis of sales trends, discount behavior, customer satisfaction, and delivery performance across different U.S. states.

Interactive visualizations and statistical models such as ANOVA, GLM, and GAM are used to uncover patterns that can help improve pricing strategies, delivery logistics, and customer segmentation.
